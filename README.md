Team Stars and Stats: A Glance at Medicare from Rating to Retention

# Project Brief
Star ratings are synonymous with the world of consumerization, influencing opinions and purchasing behavior – but is the same true in the world of healthcare?  Team Stars & Stats plan to look under the hood of Medicare Plan star ratings – ratings typically aggregated as one overall number but represent individual value of care scores that consumers weigh differently.  

By analyzing and modeling this vast data set, we want to understand if star ratings actually show correlation to enrollment choice, while predicting which plans, or plan benefits, will be popular in the future. 

## Do star ratings drive consumer choice? 
## If they do, which insurer will people predominantly go with the following year?  
## Which sub-category of coverage is ranked highest?

# Scope
CMS Medicare Data (Star Rating and Enrollment Data) 2013-2023
